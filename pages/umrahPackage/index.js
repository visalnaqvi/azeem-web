                </h2>
                <p className="content">
                    After assuming a state of Ihram, the Muhrim performs the obligatory act of Tawaf in the Al Masjid Al Haram. The Muhrim must stop reciting the Talbiyah and start circumambulation the holy Kaaba seven times (as a reminder of the angels that circumambulate the celestial realms of Allah&apos;s house, al-Bayt al-Ma&apos;mur),
                </p>


                <p className="content">They must circumambulate the Masjid Al Haram by starting from the Black Stone and completing it there at with the sincere intention of seeking closeness to Allah. The worship is validated only if the pilgrim recites the prescribed du&apos;aa (supplication) during each one of the seven circumambulations.</p>

                <p className="content">
                    The last circumambulation ends exactly where the first one began, to ensure that the pilgrim completed all seven rounds without moving or falling behind a single step or more. And with the seventh round of circumambulation and performance of eight Istilam, the state of Tawaf concludes.
                </p>

                <p className="content">
                    Upon completion of Tawaf, pilgrims can go behind Maqam Ibrahim (the station of Ibrahim) and perform Salat of Tawaf to offer the two short rak&apos;aa&apos;s and thereafter drink the holy Zamzam water from Well of Zamzam in the basement of the Sacred Mosque while supplicating to Allah.

                <p className="content">Umrah pilgrims intending to make Sa&apos;iy must make their way out of the Al Masjid Al Haram towards the Masaa&apos; (the place of Sa&apos;iy) which commemorates the struggle Prophet Abraham&apos;s wife Hazarat Hajra went through to search for water for her son in between the hills of Safa in the south and Marwah in the North. In essence, Sa&apos;iy is a great way to spend some time on self-reflection and self-realisation. Pilgrims start Sa&apos;iy by going up the hill of Safa to see the holy Kaaba from the Safa door.</p>

                <p className="content">The procedure continues with pilgrims going from Safa to Marwah and returning back to Safa, until the they complete seven laps in total. Each round is nearly 450m long. The seventh round will end at Marwah.</p>

While women are forbidden to shave their heads and only allowed to have a lock or strand of their hair clipped.

                <p className="content">All the prohibitions imposed on the conduct of pilgrims by Irham are lifted, upon completion of this last obligatory ritual. They can then remove Ihram sheets and change into their regular clothes.</p>
